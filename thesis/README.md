Fixes:

* --Smaller caption font.--
* Shape inference = shape completion.
* Space around examples, definitions, lemmata ...

Questions for Andreas:

* Get rid of the "non-probabilistic" approach for brevity?
* Which additional experiments to consider? Results on true signed distance
  function; longer training for the presented experiments; experiments
  without using the free space on KITTI and ShapeNet; experiments on
  more KITTI samples (i.e. filter less bounding boxes); experiments
  regarding the learned observation model of EVAEs ...
* The following stuff I did is not in the thesis: experiments on the car
  models from Sanja Fidler that I started with; experiments on ModelNet
  as I showed in the midterm talk; experiments using the non-probabilistic
  approach are in the appendix; supervised baseline in on rectangles and
  cuboids; any experiments with non-probabilistic priors like
  PCA or auto-encoders that I initially started with ...
