\chapter{Miscellaneous}

In this chapter, we briefly discuss additional approaches and ideas that
were investigated and implemented as part of this thesis. The first major
effort was concerned with the recently proposed OctNets \cite{RieglerGeiger:2016,
RieglerGeiger:2017}; here, the original idea was to use OctNets for shape
completion in higher resolutions. Secondly, we also investigated the
recently proposed PointNets \cite{QiSuGuibas:2016a,FanSuGuibas:2016,QiYiSuGuibas:2017}.
In this case, we were experimenting with directly operating on and predicting
point clouds instead of occupancy grids or signed distance functions defined
on grids.

In both cases, the limited scope of this thesis prevented further experiments.
Regarding OctNets, we implemented convolutional batch normalization. In the case
of PointNets, we implemented a symmetric point loss and conducted auto-encoding
experiments on 3D cuboids, the \Cub dataset from Chapter \ref{ch:data}.
